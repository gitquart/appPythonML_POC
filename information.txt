Some conclusions:
1)NLP has lots of techniques: Vectorizer, TD-IDF, Latent Semantics Analytics
2)The first step is to Vectorize each document, if we have several docs, then it turns into a matrix
2.1) Hence we talk about to transform CORPUS (Collection of documents) into a Space Vector Model (matrix)
3)The base is a matrix which can turn into different measures: TD-IDF for example
4)TD-IDF seems to be the base for LSA
